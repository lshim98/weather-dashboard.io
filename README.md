# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather-Dashboard.io

## Your Task

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that provides basic setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story

```

AS a student, I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, SO THAT I can plan a trip with friends eventually.

```
